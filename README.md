# React To-Do App

This is a fully responsive to-do app made in React. The user can add, delete, check and uncheck tasks in it. It also has a unfinished or unchecked task counter. This app also comes with localStorage to save the changes made by the user on his/her browser.

This is my first project in React. I took it has a challenge to make it all by myself, learning the basics of React alongside.
